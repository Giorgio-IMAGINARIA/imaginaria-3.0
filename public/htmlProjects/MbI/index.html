    <meta name="description" content="This is not the Intro page of Made by Italians. The page contains an animation which explains the values behind Made by Italians.
           The Made by Italians logo represents a stamp and symbolises the approval of the business awarded. Since Made by Italians protects the authenticity of
           real Italian businesses, the animation comprises an Italian flag too. The website aims to disseminate its message beyond the Italian borders, therefore
           it has a Danish, an Italian and an English version. The Danish version is due to the fact that its founder, Biase Liguori, started dreaming Made by Italians
           in Denmark and all the businesses advertised are located in the Copenhagen area as well. The three languages in which the website is translated are present
           at the bottom of the page. The founder and his partners want to expand the brand activity towards other countries and continents, then other languages will be provided soon.">
